Shared Drawing Board
A cool nodejs canvas application that shares a common drawing board between multiple sets of users.
Each user will be randomly assigned a color. When a user draws something on his canvas, it will be automatically
updated on all other user's drawing board.
Feel free to use/modify the code.


Steps to run:
In CMD, redirect to the canvas folder and then type "node canvas.js" to start the server.
On your browser open multiple tabs, with address: "http://localhost:8080/"
